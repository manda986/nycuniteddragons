    <p class="lead">The NYC United Dragons is comprised of elite paddlers from varying dragon boat clubs and paddling associations.
      These individuals have joined together to compete in the sport of dragon boat racing. United Dragons are not club-exclusive and
      encourage paddlers to continue paddling on their home teams and clubs. All that is asked is that paddlers commit to a handful of
      high-profile and international regattas.</p>

    <p class="lead">A dragon boat is a human powered boat (Paddled Water Craft) traditionally made of teak wood (in modern day the sport has seen the surge of boats made with fiberglass propelled by high tech carbon fiber paddles) in various designs and sizes. It is one of a family of Traditional Long Boats found throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. The boat is used in dragon boat racing which originated in China over 2000 years ago.</p>
