      Our crew is open to all paddlers from any club. Our home is the World's Fair Marina in Queens, NYC behind Citi Field.
      Our crew is made up of over 30 individuals, all of whom live in the NYC Metropolitan area.
      All of our members are 18+ yrs old but youth members are always welcome (we just ask that you and your parental guardian <%= link_to "sign the club waiver", asset_path('WFMCC_Electronic_Waiver.pdf') %>).

    <p class="lead">
      Member selection is based on testing, either on outrigger canoes or ERG machines. But as a result, there is <strong>no membership fee.</strong>
      Paddlers are only responsible for their own racing fees and expenses. There are several timed testing methods to determine seating:
      <ul>
        <li>200M OC-1 Sprint</li>
        <li>200M OC-2 Sprint, back person is steering only</li>
        <li>200M One-man Dragonboat paddle</li>
        <li>300M ERG Concept 2 Row with Dragonboat attachment</li>
      </ul>
